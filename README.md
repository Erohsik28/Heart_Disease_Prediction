# Heart_Disease_Prediction
The main goal of the entire project is to predict heart disease occurrence with the highest accuracy. In order to achieve this, we will test several classification algorithms. This section includes all results obtained from the study and introduces the best performer according to accuracy metric.The chosen algorithm models are Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier, Support Vector machine, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier
